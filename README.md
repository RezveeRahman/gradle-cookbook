# Gradle Cookbook

Gradle Cookbook is an open-source collection of recipes, guides and examples for the Gradle Build Tool.
This is a complementary resource to the official Gradle User Manual, which covers core capabilities maintained by the Gradle team.

The goal of this portal is to offer solution-based documentation for end users about external integrations,
including but not limited to CI/CD tools, IDEs, support for languages and frameworks, and various peripheral tools.
